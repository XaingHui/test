# StepMiner
Algorithm and sample dataset for implementation of StepMiner algorithm.
Based on Dr.Sahoo's work available at http://genedesk.ucsd.edu/home/dsahoo-thesis.pdf.

Step Miner is a novel way of determining high, mean and low values of Gene expression to perform boolean analyses, which can be used in conjunction with methods such as MidReg, for biological research using gene expression values.

This rep. contains the algorithm used for fitting the step function in O(n) complexity and sample files containing Gene expression values. The output of the source code is 4 .txt files, each containing various statistics.
